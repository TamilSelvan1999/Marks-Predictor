# Marks Predictor
The Project aims to predict student marks using Bayesian Linear Regression. Marks are considered as continuous variable here and hence we modeled the problem as regression problem. Total 6 features are used for prediction(out of total 33 as in dataset). The features are:

- Mother education
- Father education
- Studytime
- Previous class failures
- Higher education
- Absences

An intuitive user interface is also provided using `tkinter` module in Python.
